<h2>Basic information</h2>
<p>Here are some common scripts used in our project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of note, some step was done on Linux server provided by High
Performance Computing(HPC) Service of ShanghaiTech University in order
to reduce run time. So some scripts was sunmitted by using Portable Bash
Script (PBS) scripts, we will mark them in the header by using
<code>#PBS</code>. Also, there are mixture of R and Python, if readers
want to reproduce this work, please focus on the key code lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1.PBS script format: we change <code>name</code>,
<code>out file path</code> and <code>python file</code> in different
work in order to submit it into HPC. File submitted by PBS will not be

<p>4.Background sequence: TLimmuno2 outputs a continuous variable
between 0 and 1 and also percentile rank. we download all human peptide
sequence from UniPort database(2022.3) and randomly sampling peptides.
We generated a set of 90,000 13-21-mer random natural peptides (10,000
of each length). For each peptide-MHC II pair, percentile ranks were
computed based on background sequence, smaller rank indicates stronger
immunogenicity..The result maybe different as the reason of random
select.</p>

<h2>BA model training</h2>
<p>Unlike NetMHCIIpan4.0, we use the LSTM layer to construct our model.
Antigen sequences and MHC pseudo-sequences are used as inputs. We used
two LSTM layers with output sizes of 128,64 on top of the antigen and
MHC inputs. The LSTM outputs of antigen and MHC are concatenated in the
same layer to form a 128-dimensional vector. This layer is followed by
three dense layers with 100, 50, and 10 neurons activated by RELU, and
the last output layer is a single neuron dense layer activated by
sigmoid.</p>
<p>The input of this model is the peptides sequence and the MHC
sequence. The output is whether the peptides bind to the MHC molecule or
not. We used 5-fold cross-validation and the training results are shown
in training histrory.</p>

<h2>Data preprocessing</h2>
<p>Immunogenicity molecular assays were downloaded from the Immune
Epitope Database (IEDB) on May 15, 2022. The following keywords were
used: Linear peptide; T cell; Include positive and negative; Human and
any disease. We next used strict criteria for data cleaning. First, data
instances without explicit 4-digit MHC alleles were discarded. Second,
the length of the peptides is limited in the range of 13-21 mer. Third,
the data with low confidence (no information in number of subjects
tested/responded) were removed. Finally, we chose five experiment types,
“51 chromium”, “ELISA”, “ELISPOT”, “ICS” and “multimer/tetramer” to
train model as the reason of we think these are more reliable. The rest
of experiment types is used for model benchmark. In the final, we got
3930 positive instances and 2478 negative instances for training, and
105 positive instances and 4 negative instances for benchmark.</p>

<h3>Get random peptide as decoay</h3>
<p>In our data, we found that the percentage of data with immunogenic
peptides is more than the percentage of data without immunogenicity. The
reason for this problem is that the data without response information
(number of subjects tested/responded) in the IEDB dataset are also
considered as negative peptides and we removed them during data
cleaning. To avoid this anomaly, we used all human peptide sequence
download from the universal protein knowledgebase (UniProt) database
(2022.3) to get random artificial negative peptides. We generated 2
times and 5 times random peptides for each length of each MHC allele as
negative instances to construct IEDB-training dataset and IEDB-benchmark
dataset.</p>

<h2>Model train</h2>
<p>We employed transfer learning to add binding affinity information by
extract penultimate layer of BA model. We also used LSTM layers to get
antigen and MHC information, because we found our model got a great
significant improvement by using this method. We concatenated the three
numerical vectors into a single layer, added a dense layer with 400
neurons activated by RELU, a dense layer with 200 neurons activated by
RELU and the last layer with a single neuron with sigmoid activation.We
named the final model of MHC II immunogenicity prediction network based
on transfer learning as “TLimmuno2”.</p>

<p>TLimmuno2 outputs a continuous variable between 0 and 1 and also
percentile rank. For each peptide-MHC II pair, percentile ranks were
computed based on a dataset of 90,000 13- to 21-mer peptides (10,000 for
each length) randomly selected from the human proteome, smaller rank
indicates stronger immunogenicity</p>

<h2>Model perfoemance</h2>
<p>We first divided the data set into training and test sets by the
ratio of 9:1 for model training and testing. To verify the stability of
the model, 5-fold cross-validation was applied in the training process
of TLimmuno2, and TLimmuno2 shows highly stable AUC (average 0.8727)
across the validations . Overall, TLimmuno2 reaches AUC=0.9909 in
training dataset and AUC=0.8648 in the test dataset .</p>

<h2>Initial benchmark</h2>
<p>To compare with existing tools, we performed benchmark study by using
independent datasets. We first used the IEDB-benchmark dataset (Methods)
to compare the performance of TLimmuno2 and NetMHCIIpan BA/EL model.
This dataset contains 105 immunogenicity peptides, 4 non-immunogenicity
peptides and 5 times randomly selected human non-immunogenicity
peptides. In this and all of the following validation processes, data
that appeared in the training dataset were removed and thus were
completely independent of the training set. TLimmuno2 shows much better
performance (AUC: 0.9145) compared with NetMHCIIpan in this independent
dataset (BA AUC = 0.7416, EL AUC = 0.7194).</p>

<h2>Benchmark in immunoigenicity</h2>
<p>The IEDB-Benchmark dataset is from the same database as the training
set, thus they may have similar distribution patterns, which may lead to
systematic bias. To perform an unbiased performance evaluation in
predicting immunogenic peptides, we retrieved published papers to

<p>Neoepitopes tested experimentally were usually sequences of 20–25
amino acids, so we use 15-mer and k-mer methods (Methods) to assign a
rank value to a given neoepitope.</p>
<p>For the 15mer method, we split one neoepitope sequence into 15
subsequences and score or rank each subsequence. In the kmer method,
neoepitopes were cut into 13-21-mers subsequence. The prediction of the
neoepitope is the maximum score or the minimum ranking of the predicted
results of all subsequences by different methods. In case of a
neoepitope with multiple MHC types, we used the maximum score or minimum
rank of prediction for different MHC types as the prediction result for
the neoepitope.</p>

<p>We also compared the performance of TLimmuno2 with other

Repitope. Note some published methods, such as Deepitope and FIONA do
not have the tools publicly available, and are thus not included in the
subsequent comparison analysis. we can’t link their website for FIONA
and we can’t find the Github repositories for Deepitope.</p>

<p>In these comparisons, TLimmuno2 shows the best performance both in
the 15-mer method and the k-mer method. Repitope and IEDB tools evaluate
epitope immunogenicity using population MHC information, not considering
the personalized MHC allele information, and have a poor performance in
these comparisons.</p>

<h2>Structure immportance</h2>
<p>Similarly, we want to demonstrate the impact of transfer learning on
TLimmuno2, so we reconstructed two models, only BA and without BA. For
the only BA model, its input layer contains only the transfer output of
the BA model, while for the without BA, we masked the BA model and only
the LSTM layer left. The detail code of this part is not inclued in the
report. In independent validation datasets, the performance of these two
models is significant decreased compared with TLimmuno2. These results
demonstrated that the transfer learning approach improves the predictive
power of TLimmuno2 in peptide-MHC II immunogenicity prediction.</p>

<h2>Neoepitope and wildtype peptide</h2>
<p>To further demonstrate the discriminative power of TLimmuno2, we
collected 52 MHC II neoepitopes and their corresponding wild-type
peptides from published papers . These neoepitopes have been
experimentally shown to elicit T cell responses. For each neoantigen and
its corresponding wild-type peptide, we predicted the immunogenicity
rank values by TLimmuno2. As shown in Figure below, the TLimmuno2
predicted immunogenicity rank values of mutant neopeptides are
significantly lower than those of wild-type peptides, and this
demonstrates the strong ability of TLimmuno2 in recognizing real
neoepitope, even if the neoepitope differs from its wild-type peptide by
only one amino acid.</p>

<h3>TLimmuno2</h3>
<p>We performed in silico mutational analyses to investigate whether
TLimmuno2 was able to learn the molecular characteristics of the
peptide. By changing the amino acid residues at each position, we
compare the differences of the predicted values, and the largest
decrease corresponds to the greater importance of the position. We do
this in two methods: ala-scanning and zero-setting. For ala-scanning, we
sequentially replaced each position as the alanine; for zero-setting, we
sequentially mutated each position (the representation vector for the
mutated position is all zeros). We simulated this process 100 times and
an ascending ranking was performed each time to highlight the most
salient positions.</p>

<p>Both results show that P4 (residue 4), P5, and P6 are very important
for model prediction. This result is consistent with the results related
to MHC class I molecules, and it is reported that these positions are
essential for interacting with the TCR. But unlike MHC I molecules, MHC
II molecules exhibit a tendency to have less effect on model predictions
due to its position closer to the tail, possibly due to its open binding
cleft. The results of Ala-scanning are more stable rather than
zero-setting, because Ala also has biological functions.</p>

<h1>Compare with another meachine learning and other deep learning
methods</h1>
<p>To further investigate the importance of model structure to TLimmuno2
performance, we used other model architectures and compared their
performance. We constructed four traditional machine learning
classification models (AdaBoost, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM) and tuned
their hyperparameters by cross-validation. In addition, we constructed
deep learning models of deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional
neural network (CNN). All models were trained using the same data. We
validated these models in our curated neoepitope dataset.</p>

<h2>Immunotherapy</h2>
<p>To further validate TLimmuno2 and demonstrate the value of our model
as a knowledge discovery tool, we evaluated the physiological relevance
of TLimmuno2’s prediction. Most current cancer vaccine platforms
preferentially screen candidate neoepitopes for vaccine production by
selecting highly expressed candidate neoepitopes with high binding
affinity to HLA alleles. However, despite rigorous candidate selection,
many vaccine peptides do not elicit T-cell responses after vaccination.
Therefore, we compare the performance of TLimmuno2 and NetMHCIIpan by
using personalized melanoma neoepitopes with corresponding immune
response data</p>

<p>As shown in figure, TLimmuno2 performs better than the binding
affinity model in accuracy, recall and F1 score by using 2% rank as a
cut-off. The TopK metric (K=20 or 50, the number of positive samples in
the top K samples with the lowest predicted ranks) is also used to
evaluate the performance of different models, and TLimmuno2 shows
improved performance compared with netMHCIIpan BA in these TopK
metrics.</p>

<h2>Immunoediting</h2>
<p>The interactions between immune cells and tumor cells are reflected
as immunoediting, which could mediate the negative selection of DNA
alterations encoding high immunogenicity. The status of MHC class II
neoantigen mediated negative selection in cancer evolution is still
unknown. We next applied the TLimmuno2 to predict the immunogenicity of
neopeptides arising from missense mutation in TCGA samples.</p>
<p>We then detect the immunoediting signals in TCGA samples by using the
previously published CCF enrichment score (ESccf) method</p>
<p>we download 33 cancer type somatic mutation file form <a

<p>By comparing prediction score and rank value in each TCGA samples, we
found that most scores are less than 0.1 and the median rank value is
around 0.5. It suggest that most mutant peptides are
non-immunogenic.</p>

<h4>Compare the different of MHCI BA ,MHCII BA and Immunogenicity</h4>
<p>To evaluate the extent to which the TLimmuno2 learned a signal that
is also learned by the binding affinity predictor, we measured the
Pearson correlation between immunogenicity rank and binding affinity

<p>The correlations were positive, significant but low in magnitude,
median Pearson r2 = 0.0968 in the compare between MHC I binding affinity
rank and MHC II immunogenicity rank; and median Pearson r2 = 0.2057 in
the compare between MHC II binding affinity rank and MHC II
immunogenicity rank . Overall, this analysis suggested that the
TLimmuno2 is at least partially non-redundant with the binding affinity
predictor.</p>

<p>In TCGA pan-cancer cohort, when samples with antigenic and driver
mutations lying on the same gene are removed, the observed median ESCCF
is -0.024 (n = 5,524, P-value = 0.0005). By comparing simulated median
ES distribution, several cancer types including adrenocortical carcinoma
(ACC), Thymoma (THYM), Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), Cervical squamous
cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), Cervical squamous
cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (LUAD) show significant
low ESCCF values</p>
